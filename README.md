# Israeli Elecftions - Updated

# Data Source

The Election Committee has taken down the files, but you can still access the unmodified here [on my original project](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren/Israel-Data) - or partly on the historical section of the current [Knesset Election Site](https://www.gov.il/he/Departments/Guides/election-committee-history?chapterIndex=6).
